# SSH Access to CSCS Cluster

<div grid="~ cols-12 gap-4">
<div class="col-span-4">

- For a convenience, it is recommended to add the following lines to your `~/.ssh/config` file

```
Host ela
    HostName ela.cscs.ch
    User <YOUR_USERNAME>
    ForwardAgent yes
    ForwardX11 yes

Host daint
    HostName daint.cscs.ch
    User <YOUR_USERNAME>
    ProxyJump ela
    ForwardAgent yes
    ForwardX11 yes
```

</div>
<div class="col-span-7">


- After that, you can connect to the cluster using the command below

```bash
$ ssh <YOUR_USERNAME>@daint
```

- You should be dropped into the `bash` shell in your home directory
- For launching jobs and we use the scratch directory

```bash
$ cd $SCRATCH
```

- here you can git-clone the course material

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/eth-cscs/pytorch-training.git
```
